                        <h3>The Big Move</h3>
                        <p>
                            Originally born in Hong Kong, I moved to the United States when I was three years old. I spent the next 18 years of my life in St. Louis and graduated high school at Ladue Hortin Watkins in 2014.

                        <p>
                            I started studying at the University of Missouri - Columbia, initially with a biology degree, but changed to degrees after volunteering at my school's International Center and made many connections around the world.
                            I spent the next four years of my life as an ambassador for international students and showing them American culture. It definitely impacted my decision to study abroad in Japan in 2018 and eventually led to me to travel to over 10 countries in a year.

                        <h3>Travels</h3>
                            <h4 class="travel">Japan/Korea</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Before university, I had never traveled outside the midwest after my initial move to the US. My first time abraod was going to Japan, which has always been my dream since I was a child. I lived in a small town in the country called Hikone. Little to no people knew English there, so I really got to imerse myself in the language/culture.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My first couple of days in Japan, I stayed with my friend in Tokyo and since it was the first week of the New Year, she took me to Meiji Shrine to do a "hatsumairi"! Otherwise, known as the first shrine visit of the New Year. In Japan, the majority religion is Shinto, "the way of the gods". Did you know, they even have a god for the toilet?
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    I visited many different temples and shrines throughout my stay in Japan. Even the famous, Inari Shrine and Meiji Shrine.
                                </p>

                                    As sad as it was to leave Japan, I was able to meet all the friends I made through the International Center in Korea. What I've noticed in Asian countries is that they focus a lot on presentation. Even in McDonalds, the chicken nuggets I ordered were all lined up in a box, whereas here in the States, they're just thrown into a box and often missing a piece or two :(.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    And after I spent a couple weeks in Korea, I went home to Hong Kong to visit my family. By now, I've probably already gained 10 pounds from all the different food I ate and about to gain 10 more.
                                </p>

                                    I was lucky enough to get invited along to their trip to the Balkans. The food wasn't the greatest, as the diet largely consists of only meat and potatoes, but the scenary made up for it. My favorite destination being Dubrovnik, Croatia. The water was so clear and blue. It really felt like a dream to be there. It is also the setting for King's Landing from The Game of Thrones.

                        <h3>Other Major Events</h3>
                            <p>In May of 2019, I graduated with my BA in International Studies. Initially planning to teach English abroad, however, due to family health reasons, decided not to go. The same summer, I got my US citizenship! The test was harder than it needs to be. I'm pretty sure 80% of natural born citizens will fail it... Like everyone needs to know what war Eisenhower served as General for.</p>

                <h2>Where I Am Now (2020)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Life before COVID-19, I was working as a barista, meanwhile, job hunting and studying my first coding languages, HTML/CSS. I got through the curriculum via freecodecamp, however met a blockroad with Javascript. I watched the videos and read the chapters, but retained no real information as I did not have a practical use for it.
                        One of my co-workers was also interesting in development and told me about LaunchCode. So, in March of 2020, I applied to LC101 and here I am!

            <h2>Where I'll Go From Here (2021 - )</h2>
                <p>
                    I don't have an exact endgoal of what I want after I graduate from this program. I have always been into tech and computers, but have no idea in which field I would like to take. I am still young, so I have plenty of time to figure it out. I think it's most important to just try it out and try to get my foot in the door with an apprenticeship after LaunchOff. I look forward to seeing what doors this program opens up for me!
